### Security
Basic authentication can be added via `AuthenticationSecret`. It is **NOT** recommended to expose immichFrame to the public web, if you still choose to do so, you can set this to a secure secret. Every client needs to authenticate itself with this secret. This can be done in the Webclient via input field or via URL-Parameter. The URL-Parameter will look like this: `?authsecret=[MYSECRET]`

If this is enabled, the web api required the `Authorization`-Header with `Bearer [MYSECRET]`.

### Filtering on Albums or People
You can get the UUIDs from the URL of the album/person. For this URL: `https://demo.immich.app/albums/85c85b29-c95d-4a8b-90f7-c87da1d518ba` this is the UUID: `85c85b29-c95d-4a8b-90f7-c87da1d518ba`

### Weather
Weather is enabled by entering an API key. Get yours free from [OpenWeatherMap][openweathermap-url]

### Calendar
If you are using Google Calendar, more information can be found [here](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37648?hl=en#zippy=%2Cget-your-calendar-view-only).

### Overlay Positioning
You can customize the position of different overlays on the screen:

- **ClockPosition**: Controls where the clock, date, and weather information appears
- **AssetInfoPosition**: Controls where image metadata (date, description, people, albums, location) appears  
- **AppointmentsPosition**: Controls where calendar appointments appear

Each position setting uses the format `vertical-horizontal` with these options:
- **Vertical**: `top` or `bottom`
- **Horizontal**: `left`, `center`, or `right`

For example: `top-left`, `bottom-center`, `top-right`, etc.

### Misc
#### Webhook
A webhook to notify an external service is available. This is only enabled when the `Webhook`-Setting is set in your configuration. Your configured Webhook will be notified via `HTTP POST`-request.

A client can be identified by the `ClientIdentifier`. You can set/overwrite the `ClientIdentifier` by adding `?client=MyClient` to your ImmichFrame-URL. This only needs to be called once and is persisted. Delete the cache to reset the `ClientIdentifier`.

#### Events
Events will always contain a `Name`, `ClientIdentifier` and a `DateTime` to differentiate, but can contain more information.

| **Event**                  | **Description**                      | **Payload**                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ImageRequestedNotification | Notifies when an image is requested. | `{"Name":"ImageRequestedNotification", "ClientIdentifier": "Frame_Kitchen", "DateTime":"2024-11-16T21:37:19.4933981+01:00", "RequestedImageId":"UUID"}` |

### Multiple Immich Accounts
ImmichFrame can be configured to access multiple Immich accounts, on the same or different servers.

Images will be drawn from each account proportionally based on the total number of images present in each account (not included filtering, this is not yet implemented).

### Custom CSS
ImmichFrame can be customized even further using CSS. This will apply to browsers, and apps using WebView (i.e. everything but Frameo and AppleTV):
- Create a custom.css file somewhere on your host server with your desired content, for example:  
```css
#progressbar {  
  visibility: hidden;  
}
```
- Add an entry in your immichframe compose pointing to it:  
```
volumes:  
      - /PATH/TO/YOUR/custom.css:/app/wwwroot/static/custom.css
```
