# ImmichFrame – Claude Instructions

## Release Writeup Rule

When asked to create a release writeup or release notes, follow this process and format:

### Process

1. Run `git log --oneline <prev-tag>..HEAD` to get all commits since the last release.
2. Run `git diff <prev-tag>..HEAD --stat` to understand the scope of changes.
3. Fetch the GitHub release page if a URL is provided to cross-reference the auto-generated changelog.
4. Combine the raw git history with the GitHub changelog to produce a human-friendly writeup.

### Output Format

Use the template at `templates/release-template.md`. Key rules:

- **Title**: `# 📦 ImmichFrame Release vX.X.X.X – <Date>`
- **Intro**: One sentence summarising the release highlights (no heading).
- **Sections**: Follow the category order from `.github/release.yml` — Breaking Changes, New Features, Fixes, Documentation, Maintenance, Other Changes.
- **Each entry**:
  - H4 heading with emoji + feature name
  - Bold `**PR [#NNN](url) by @author**` attribution line
  - 2–4 sentences describing *what* changed and *why it matters* to the user
  - Include a code block if a config snippet helps illustrate usage
  - Separate entries with `---`
- **New Contributors**: Call out first-time contributors with 🎉
- **Footer**: Always end with the full changelog comparison URL.

### Tone

- Write for end users, not developers. Avoid internal refactor jargon unless it has a user-visible effect.
- Keep descriptions concise — 2–4 sentences per entry is enough.
- Use "you" / "your" to address users directly.
